This is a web page for my friend who gives private English lessons. His idea is to do a full course, 3-mounth bootcamp 
of speaking and this is the topic of this page. For now it is just a static page HTML + CSS making only marketing and contact functions. I hope the future show anydynamic functionality to be necessery because I want to do this.
